sails-swagr
=========

Originally forked from [swagger-express](https://github.com/fliptoo/swagger-express), however, heavily 
customized to meet Swagger 2.0 specifications and to work solely with [Sails](http://sailsjs.org/).

__sails-swagr__ is a simple and clean solution to integrate swagger with Sails.

### Summary

This module will do it best to autogenerate everything it can from Sails configuration and create
a Swagger 2.0 JSON Specification to be used with the Swagger-UI. After routes and models have been generated, 
you may create a `docs` directory under `api/` and place YML documents with paths definitions for each Controller. As a result, the generated JSONs and YAMLs will be **merged**. 

## Installation

    $ npm install sails-swagr --save

## Quick Start

Configure sails-swagr as express middleware.


`apiVersion`      -> Your api version.

`swaggerVersion`  -> Swagger version.

`swaggerURL`      -> Path to use for swagger ui web interface.

`swaggerJSON`     -> Path to use for swagger ui JSON.

`basePath`        -> The basePath for swagger.js

`info`            -> [Metadata][info] about the API

`apis`            -> Define your api array.

`middleware`      -> Function before response.

## Sails Integration

Modify the `config/http.js` to look like:

```
customMiddleware: function (app) {
    var swagger = require('sails-swagr');  
    var express = require('sails/node_modules/express');

    app.use(swagger.init(express, app, {
        apiVersion: '1.0',
        swaggerVersion: '2.0',
        swaggerURL: '/api/docs',
        swaggerJSON: '/api-docs.json',
        basePath: sails.getBaseurl(),
        info: {
          title: ' API Swagger Documentation',
          description: 'Sails Swagr'
        },
        apis: [
          './api/docs/Cards.yml', 
          './api/docs/Stories.yml',
          './api/docs/Users.yml',
        ]
    })); 
    sails.on('ready', function() {
      swagger.sailsGenerate({
        routes: sails.router._privateRouter.routes,
        models: sails.models
      });
    });
  }

```

#### Swagger-UI

Lift sails and navigate to the specified `swaggerURL` e.g. 

```
http://localhost:1337/api/docs
```


## Read from YAML file

Example 'Users.yml'

```yml

paths:
  /login:
    post:
      summary: Login with username and password
      notes: Returns a user based on username
      responseClass: User
      nickname: login
      consumes: 
        - text/html
      parameters:

      - name: username
        dataType: string
        paramType: query
        required: true
        description: Your username

      - name: password
        dataType: string
        paramType: query
        required: true
        description: Your password

definitions:
  User:
    properties:
      username:
        type: String
      password:
        type: String    
```
